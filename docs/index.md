# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for the [angelnu Helm charts](https://github.com/angelnu/helm-charts) project.

I publish here helm charts that I use for my kubernetes at home cluster.

## Getting started

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts in this repository.

Refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

## Installation

```sh
helm repo add angelnu http://angelnu.github.io/helm-charts/
```

You can then run `helm search repo angelnu` to search the charts.
